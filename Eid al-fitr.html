<p>Eid al-Fitr, also known as the "Festival of Breaking the Fast," is a joyful Islamic holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting, prayer, and reflection. Celebrated on the first day of the lunar month of Shawwal, Eid al-Fitr begins with a special prayer known as Salat al-Eid, where Muslims gather in mosques or open spaces to pray and hear a sermon. Before the prayer, Muslims are required to give Zakat al-Fitr, a form of charity intended to support those in need, ensuring that everyone can join in the celebrations. Families and friends then come together to share meals, often featuring traditional dishes and sweets that vary by culture. It’s customary to wear new or best clothes, exchange gifts, and greet each other with “Eid Mubarak,” meaning “Blessed Eid.” The holiday emphasizes gratitude, compassion, and unity, allowing Muslims worldwide to celebrate the end of Ramadan with a renewed sense of community and spiritual fulfillment.
