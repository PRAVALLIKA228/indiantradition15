<h1>Spirituality</h1>
<p>Spirituality often refers to a sense of connection to something greater than oneself, encompassing a personal search for meaning in life. It involves various practices, such as meditation, prayer, mindfulness, and rituals, through which individuals may find spiritual fulfillment in nature, community, art, or personal reflection. While spirituality can be linked to organized religions like Christianity, Buddhism, or Hinduism, it can also exist independently of traditional religious frameworks; many individuals identify as spiritual but not religious. The goals of spirituality typically include personal growth, inner peace, and a profound sense of belonging or connection to the universe.</p>
